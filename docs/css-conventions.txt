The following are the style conventions for all CSS3 code in this project.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Standard properties within a selector should always appear in alphabetical
order. Vendor prefixes should follow the standard properties they relate to.

  for example:

  .some-element {
    align-items: center;
    appearance: none;
    -webkit-appearance: none
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
  }

2. Selectors should appear in order that their HTML elements appear on the page,
from top to bottom, and left to right. Pseudo-selectors should be grouped with
their non-psuedo counterpart.
