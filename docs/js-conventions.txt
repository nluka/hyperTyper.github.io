The following are the style conventions for all JS code in this project.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Any global variables that reference HTML elements should mention what
element type they hold at the end of their name, separated by an underscore.
Any local variables that mention HTML elements should mention what element type
they hold at the end of their name, in camelCase

  e.g, global variables:
  let somePanel_div;
  let html_body;
  let phraseList_buttons (this is an example of an array of elements)

  e.g, local variables:
  const someSpan;
  let someDiv;

2. In places where tracking the type of data a variable holds is relevant,
variable names should indicate the type of data they will hold; at the end of
their name, separated by an underscore.

  for example:

  const stringifiedSoundVolume = localStorage.getItem("soundVolume");
  const soundVolumeFloat = parseFloat(stringifiedSoundVolume);
