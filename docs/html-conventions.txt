The following are the style conventions for all HTML5 code in this project.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Use only lowercase letters for markup. Uppercase is acceptable for content.

2. Always add quotes around attribute values.

3. Always specify alt, width, and height for images.

4. Avoid using spaces around equal signs.

5. For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical markup blocks.

6. To improve compatibility with browsers, do not omit elements just because
they are implied or the default value for one browser works.

8. Avoid using inline CSS styling, unless it's added by JS code.

9. Avoid using the <script> tag to implement JS code, only use it for linking
files to the page. JS files should be in the document head marked with "defer"
instead of being placed at the bottom of the <body> tag.

10. Class attributes should be all lowercase, with dashes in between words.

  for example:

  class="toggle-button"

11. IDs should be camelCase and include the element type at the end.

  for example:

  id="toggleButton"
  id="playerTextInput"
  id="expressionDiv"

12. Empty elements should be closed.

  for example:

  <meta charset="utf-8">
    should instead be
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
