# hyperTyper

## Introduction

hyperTyper is a highly-customizable web application designed for practicing typing skills in the most comprehensive way. It is meant to improve upon popular platforms such as typeracer.com, keybr.com, 10fastfingers, etc. It takes some inspiration from these platforms, makes changes and adds useful tools and features. I designed this application to be the most effective way to practice typing skills for everyone, including programmers. In my opinion, hyperTyper is a vast improvement to the aforementioned platforms and is thus my platform of choice for working on my typing skills.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to learn web development with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript and gain practical programming/development experience by building a large, real world project on my own - to get out of "tutorial hell". This project is entirely my creation, and isn't based on tutorial projects.

## What I Learned

- Fundamentals of web development with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- TypeScript, and converting a vanilla JavaScript project to utilize TypeScript
- Working in and managing a large codebase that spans dozens of files
- Web design principles and how to apply them in an unconventional project
- Refactoring, and the importance of writing clean code
- API consumption with fetch
- Using GitHub as a repository and a hosting platform (GitHub Pages)
- Finding, reading, utilizing documentation related to web development
- Asynchronous programming in JavaScript
- DOM traversal and manipulation (used extensively throughout the project)
- Debugging in the browser
- Regular Expressions
- JSON
- Webscraping with Python (BeautifulSoup)

## Code and Style Conventions

This project follows certain conventions, which are outlined out in the text files within /docs. There is also a project lexicon there.

## Compatibility

This project was developed with several modern browsers in mind, such as Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera. I have tried to maximize compatibility across those browsers. However, this project was mostly developed with Google Chrome and thus is the most compatible browser. The project has been converted from vanilla modern JavaScript to utilize TypeScript, which has increased compatibility for browsers that lack implementation of some modern JavaScript features.

## Future

This project continues to be expanded and worked upon. There are many plans for new features and changes/improvements to existing ones. To see what's in the works, check out the Trello board: https://trello.com/b/S7YE0keL.
